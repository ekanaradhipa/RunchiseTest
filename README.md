4. run "cucumber features/add_cart_main.feature" on terminal

Notes:
Still incomplete because developer still has problem accessing cart page, either via link or button

What to improve:
1. Better XPATH
2. Better loading time, for now rely on sleep
3. Find ways to enter cart page, since via link is unsuccesful
